Google News(https://news.google.com) sorted into eight categories:

1. Country News(For Ex. India)
2. World
3. Business
4. Technology
5. Entertainment
6. Sports
7. Science
8. Health

If we read news from one category then we miss the other categories.

To read the news from all the categories at the same time, I created two web apps, one using PHP and the other using Node.js.
These web apps display eight news articles(one article from each category) at the start.
Clicking on the "load more" button, loads eight more news articles(one article from each category).

If you have Node.js server then you can download the "withNode.js" folder.
"gnews.js" is the main file. Executing this file in the terminal creates a server with port 3000.
Type localhost:3000 in the browser.
It takes around 10 seconds(based on your internet speed) to load all the news from all the categories.

If you have PHP server then you can download the "withPhp" folder.
"gnews.php" is the main file.
